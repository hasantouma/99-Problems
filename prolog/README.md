Solving the Prolog 99 Problems Challenge
------------
On this [Prolog website][prolog link], there is a list of 99 Problems solved in Prolog. My goal is to complete these problems on my own. By doing so, I hope to improve my understanding and skill of Prolog and Logic Programming Langauges overall.
